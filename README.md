# Codewars Solutions

## What It Is:
This repo contains solutions and explanations to problems from 8 kyu all the way
to 1 kyu.

## Notes:
This guide is strictly used to get a better grasp and fundamental idea on why
the answer is what it is with comments detailing each section of the code. You
are doing self-harm if you are just copying and pasting and expecting to get
hired if you can't back it up without solving it yourself.

P.S. These solutions are not considered to be best practices. These are simply
to understand how you got to the answer and why it works!
